## General info

The game of Hangman where a random word is selected from a list and the user must guess the correct letters. If a wrong letter is chosen it displays it and updates the Hangman figure part. If a correct letter is chosen it updates the letter of the word. Learn about SVG's primitive shapes and use them. Practice the use of array methods and key event listeners.
